1.4Q) Explain JWT in approx and prove it's top 3 benefits?
	- JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. 
	- Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims.
	- the user submits the username and password to an Authentication server, which might be our Application server, 
	- the Authentication server validates the username and password combination and creates a JWT token with a payload containing 
	  the user technical identifier and an expiration timestamp
	- the Authentication server then takes a secret key, and uses it to sign the Header plus Payload and sends it back to the user browser 
	- the browser takes the signed JWT and starts sending it with each HTTP request to our Application server
	- our Application server checks the JWT signature and confirms that indeed someone in possession of the secret key signed this particular Payload
	- The Payload identifies a particular user via a technical identifier
	- Only the Authentication server is in possession of the private key, and the Authentication server only gives out tokens to users 
	  that submit the correct password
	- therefore our Application server can safely be sure that this token was indeed given to this particular user by the Authentication server, 
	  meaning that it's indeed the user as it had the right password
	- The server proceeds with processing the HTTP request assuming that it indeed it belongs to that user
	
	Advantages
	- Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims.
	- it is more secure because it's signed
	- it is easy to use
	- jwt is more flexible
	- it is stored only on the client 
	- It’s quick to verify a JWT since it doesn’t require a database lookup. This is especially useful in large distributed systems
